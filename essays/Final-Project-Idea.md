Gaming Buddy application, user logs in and is able to choose what games they're interested in (including video games, board games, card games like Magic the Gathering etc). Users can choose to indicate they are "Looking for a Game", we're unsure how we want to implement this, but either it will give them a notification that someone else is looking to play a game they are interested in, or it connects the two and allows them to send messages to each other. If this is a online game like League of Legends, it will allow them to share their in game usernames. The "special sauce" here comes into play when the user wants to meetup for a physical card/board game, we can make use of the google maps api to show where users are around UH Manoa "looking for a game", perhaps someone wants to play Monopoly at HolmesHall, but you don't wanna walk that far, so you settle for a game of Exploding Kittens at Hamilton.
