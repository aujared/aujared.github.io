## Inital Thoughts About JavaScript
As a Computer Engineering Student with no experience in JavaScript or Java, I am able to provide a complete beginner’s perspective to this JavaScript module. In Computer Engineering, we learn C and C++, and I also have experience in C# and Python from previous projects, from this initial introduction I can see that many of my programming skills carry over, I just need to find the right way to apply them to JavaScript. One thing that I liked right off the back was the lack of variable type description, I encounter many errors in C and C++ with declaring things as integers vs floats etc., and simply being able to use var, let or const makes things so much easier.

## Is JavaScript a Good or Bad Language?
In regards to JavaScript being a good or bad language, I feel that I’ll need more time with it, but I am liking many of its conveniences, and think that I just need to switch my mindset over and I’ll be able to hit the ground running. A good comparison for this is C vs C++, in C you need to write mostly everything you need (Vectors, maps, etc.) whereas there are predefined data structures in C++ with conventions that need to be followed. I personally like writing them myself in C, but was able to do well in our C++ class after I got into the rhythm of using established conventions.

## Opinions on Athletic Software Engineering
I like the idea of Athletic Software Engineering, making constant use of your programming knowledge and practicing it regularly is a good way to improve and keep the skill healthy, like training a muscle or practicing for a sport. I am slightly concerned with my difficult classes this semester but will try my absolute hardest to manage my time efficiently and work ahead as much as possible. I’m actually practicing that right now! Completing this essay on Tuesday 9/3/19, so I can get started on next week’s assignments ASAP. 
The practice WODs and Branden’s sessions are a excellent source of learning, when I learn programming on my own, I try to seek out similar problems and challenges to learn and practice problem solving skills. However, I often get lazy and stop practicing them, by incorporating these things as part of the class, I really get the practice I need to learn a new language efficiently. This style of teaching really encompasses what a student should be doing on their own to learn, and helps ease us into it, hopefully giving us the capacity to do it later in our careers. It has renewed my desire to learn independently and manage my time effectively to not only pass the class, but thrive. 

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I think that the in class timed WODs will be a bit stressful, and I do like them a bit less than the practice WODs, but for a software engineering class, it is a fair and apt way to assess the skill level of students. I do enjoy problem solving and thinking on my feet, so I don’t particularly hate the idea of timed programming problems, but I do want to get an A for this class, and thus need to put in a solid amount of preparation. 

In conclusion, I think that the pedagogy put forth by this class is an interesting one, and I will adapt myself and my study habits to make sure that it works for me, putting in my best effort, and attending Brandon’s weekly practice WOD’s while constantly working ahead to give myself the best chance of success.
